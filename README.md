## 🎯 Objectives of the Project
The main objectives of CleanRoute360 are:

- To provide a **centralized system** for managing waste collection operations
- To reduce **manual work** using Salesforce automation tools
- To ensure **secure, role-based access** for different users
- To track routes, services, and operational status efficiently
- To generate **reports and insights** for better decision-making

## 🧩 Project Phases
The project is developed and documented in a **phase-wise manner**:

1. **Problem Identification & Objective Analysis**  
2. **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control**  
3. **Data Modeling & Custom Object Design**  
4. **User Interface & Page Layout Customization**  
5. **Automation & Business Process Implementation**  
6. **Reports, Monitoring & Data Analysis**  
7. **Testing, Validation & Final Demonstration**

Each phase is documented separately and uploaded as individual files for clarity and evaluation.
